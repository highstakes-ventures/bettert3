    "Create a Mation schedule through T3's scheduling adapter. Mation owns both recurring automations and one-time triggers. For a one-time continuation, use {type:'once', at:<ISO timestamp>} bound to the existing chat. Mation consumes the trigger once; never use a repeating timer with instructions to pause itself. T3 keeps the chat in Waiting while the trigger or its dispatch is pending. Keep the existing chat identity and do not settle it while work is pending. Pass schedule as a STRUCTURED OBJECT, never JSON text. Timers: {type:'interval', everyMs:3600000} is hourly; {type:'fixed_time', timeOfDay:'09:00', weekdays:[1,2,3,4,5]} is weekday mornings; report the returned nextRunAt. Webhook dedupe accepts replayKey and coalesceKey templates with coalesceWindowSeconds (10–3600, default 120); replay keys expire after 7 days and coalescing keeps the latest payload in a window measured from its first delivery. Webhooks: {type:'webhook'} runs once per request to a generated URL. The run sees the request ONLY through prompt placeholders: {{body.path}} (e.g. {{body.action}}, {{body.release.tag_name}}), {{headers.name}}, {{query.name}}, {{body}}, or {{request}} (method, headers with credentials redacted, and body). Each value arrives framed as untrusted request data, and $skill, @file or /command mentions inside it do not act; without a signature, anyone with the URL can trigger a run. For a sender that signs requests, first call request_secret so the user enters the secret privately (never ask for it in chat or invent one), then set signature with the returned secretRef, e.g. GitHub: {type:'webhook', signature:{header:'x-hub-signature-256', encoding:'hex', prefix:'sha256=', secretRef}}. To run only for some requests, add filters, all of which must match, e.g. filters:[{path:'headers.x-github-event', op:'equals', value:'pull_request'}, {path:'body.action', op:'in', value:['opened','reopened']}]; ops are equals, notEquals, in, startsWith and exists. A path segment ending in [] fans out over an array: {path:'body.issue.labels[].name', op:'equals', value:'needs more info'} matches when any label has that name, and notEquals only when none does. The result's webhookUrl is the public URL to give the user; if it is absent, this environment has no T3 Connect managed tunnel, so tell the user to enable T3 Connect remote access rather than sharing a path. Omit projectId for this thread's project. In this thread's project, runs post into THIS thread by default (bindToCurrentThread=true), which suits an orchestrator that sees every trigger, delegates work, and can dedupe against what is in flight; use false only when the user wants a fresh top-level thread per run. Elsewhere each run launches a fresh thread. Provider, model, and runtime settings inherit from this thread, or from the project default when there is no calling thread.",
